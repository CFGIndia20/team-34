## Problem Statement Description 
The foundation faces difficulty in distributing students to batches that run on the time slots preferred by students. Presently, the batch allocation is done as per the teacher's preference which sometimes leads to students dropping out of the course. Also, this entire process runs in manual mode. Hence, a fully automated solution is required which overcomes the downfalls of all such situations.

## Solution Proposed
 - Automated distribution of student in different batches.
 - Automated allotment of teachers to thier respective batches.
 - Dashboard for Admin - To trigger automated resource allocation and batch formation.
 - Dashboard for Teachers - To mark attendance, award scores, broadcast links, view their schedule and communicate with admin.
 - Dashboard for Students - To keep a track on their progress and schedule.
